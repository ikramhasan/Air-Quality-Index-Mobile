        'The smaller particles or PM2.5 are lighter and go deeper into the lungs and cause greater damage longer term. They also stay in the air longer and travel farther. PM10 (big) particles can stay in the air for minutes or hours while PM2.5 (small) particles can stay in the air for days or weeks. And travel? PM10 particles can travel as little as a hundred yards or as much as 30 miles. PM2.5 particles go even farther; many hundreds of miles. As a result, even though we measure both PM2.5 and PM10, we lay much greater stress on PM2.5 which is the more harmful among the two.';
